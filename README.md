## Setup

Run the following commands in your terminal:

```sh
npm install
npx knex migrate:latest
npx knex seed:run
mv .env.example .env
```

To run in development:
```sh
npm run dev
```

To run in production:
```sh
npm start
```


## Heroku!!!

### Creating your app

Create your app with `heroku create [name]`

You can check that this was successful by running `heroku apps` to view a list of your apps


### Adding postgres

Add postgresql (hobby dev) to your app at `https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/[APP NAME HERE]/resources`

Check that pg has been added by running `heroku addons` to ensure the postgresql db is on your app


### Deploying!

I have created several npm scripts that will be useful for deploying your app to heroku easily.

To push your local master branch to your heroku app:
```sh
npm run h:deploy
```

Run heroku migrations:
```sh
npm run h:migrate
```

Run heroku seeds:
```sh
npm run h:seed
```

If ever you need to rollback, you can also:
```sh
npm run h:rollback
```


### Ta-Da!
Your app should be deployed!
